This plugin integrates Affiliates with WooCommerce.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates [Affiliates](http://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates/) with [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

With this integration plugin, referrals are created automatically for your affiliates when sales are made.

The plugin allows you to set a referral (commission) rate so that your affiliates get credited with a referral based on a percentage of each sale's total net amount.

An advanced integration that synchronizes the referrals to their order status is available with [Affiliates Pro](http://www.itthinx.com/shop/affiliates-pro/) and [Affiliates Enterprise](http://www.itthinx.com/shop/affiliates-enterprise/).

*Affiliates* is an outstanding platform that helps to boost sales through your affiliate program and is the ideal affiliate solution for *WooCommerce*.
