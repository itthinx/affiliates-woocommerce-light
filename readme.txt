== Description ==

__Grow your Business__ with your own Affiliate Network and let your partners earn commissions on referred sales.

This plugin integrates [Affiliates](https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates/) with [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

With this integration plugin, referrals are created automatically for your affiliates when sales are made.

The plugin allows you to set a referral (commission) rate, so that your affiliates get credited with a referral, based on a percentage of each sale's total net amount.
